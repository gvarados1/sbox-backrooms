            5 entries in the leaderboard. If The current user has no entry, this will return null.

             Allows you to force verify game content on next launch.
            
             If you detect the game is out-of-date(for example, by having the client detect a version mismatch with a server),
             you can call use MarkContentCorrupt to force a verify, show a message to the user, and then quit.

            check internally. Forcefully disabling stuff when the player loses access is usually not a 
            very good experience for the player and you could be preventing them from accessing APIs that do not

            NOTE: The URL has a very short lifetime to prevent history-snooping attacks, so you should only call this API when you are about to launch the browser, or else immediately navigate to the result URL using a hidden browser window.
            NOTE: The resulting authorization cookie has an expiration time of one day, so it would be a good idea to request and visit a new auth URL every 12 hours.

            This call can be rate limited. Call frequency should be on the order of minutes, rather than seconds.You should only be calling this during major state changes such as the end of a round, the map changing, or the user leaving a server. This call is required to display the achievement unlock notification dialog though, so if you have called SetAchievement then it's advisable to call this soon after that.
            If you have stats or achievements that you have saved locally but haven't uploaded with this function when your application process ends then this function will automatically be called.
            You can find additional debug information written to the %steam_install%\logs\stats_log.txt file.

            RequestCurrentStats has completed and successfully returned its callback AND

             However, if you have a game that only refreshes the screen on an event driven basis then that can break 
             the overlay, as it uses your Present/SwapBuffers calls to drive it's internal frame loop and it may also
             need to Present() to the screen any time an even needing a notification happens or when the overlay is
             brought up over the game by a user.  You can use this API to ask the overlay if it currently need a present
             in that case, and then you can check for this periodically (roughly 33hz is desirable) and make sure you
             refresh the screen with Present or SwapBuffers to allow the overlay to do it's work.

            <summary>
            Serialized result sets contain a short signature which can't be forged or replayed across different game sessions.
            A result set can be serialized on the local client, transmitted to other players via your game networking, and 
            deserialized by the remote players.This is a secure way of preventing hackers from lying about posessing 
            rare/high-value items. Serializes a result set with signature bytes to an output buffer.The size of a serialized 
            result depends on the number items which are being serialized.When securely transmitting items to other players, 
            it is recommended to use GetItemsByID first to create a minimal result set.
            Results have a built-in timestamp which will be considered "expired" after an hour has elapsed.See DeserializeResult
            for expiration handling.
